# polynomial-calculator
Polynomial calculator users can interact on the console. Users can do multiple operations after entering two polynomials, such as addition, subtraction, and differentiation. A linked list is used as its data structure. Big five (copy constructor, copy assignment, destructor, move constructor, move assignment) is also implemented.
